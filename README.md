# demo_notebooks
Demo notebooks for teaching/demonstration purposes

GitHub often fails to render notebooks. If that happenes to you too, you may check the Nbviewer for offline view: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patbaa/demo_notebooks/tree/master/

Or Colab for interactive running: https://colab.research.google.com/github/patbaa/demo_notebooks/blob/master/

I recommend the second option, as for most of the notebooks the outputs were deleted, so you will only get them after running the cells.
